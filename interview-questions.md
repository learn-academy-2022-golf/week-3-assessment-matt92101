3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?


Your answer:

An anonymous function is a function that serves as a function in Javascript by does not have any identifying features commonly found in functions such as parameters. It can be thought of as an empty shell.


Researched answer:

An anonymous function is a function without a name. Anonymous functions are particularly useful when a developer wants to pass arguments into it. In most instances, an anonymous function will need to be assigned to a variable.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer:
State values are temporary data storages for information. One example of state values could be a shopping cart within a website. The shopping cart may hold many items temporarily. However, with the user refreshes the website, the data inside the shopping cart is lost. Props is short for properties in React. These properties serve as better defining certain elements.

Researched answer:

Props are a type of object in React. Their main function is to pass data from one component to another. On the other hand, the state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer:

DOM is apparent when certain events are activated such as clicking the mouse.

Researched answer:

DOM stands for Document Object Model which includes various events. Some possible events may be clicking the mouse on an HTML object or submitting a form on a webpage. For example, when a webpage is displaying a photo without any associated DOM events, the photo will remain static and cause any events. However, it the developer makes the photo enlarge by allowing the user to move the mouse pointer over the photo, a mouseover DOM has been been envoked.

Your answer:
